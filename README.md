#Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Practice Projects

- Collaborative Filtering

 - if person A has the same opinion as person B, A is likely to have B's opinion
on different issue compared to a randomly chosed person

- Memory Based:

 - Item-Based: takes similarities between item's consumption history
  Cosine Based/Correlation Based/Adjusted Cosine Based

 - User-Based: considers similarities between user consumption and item consumption histories

- Model Based: clustering/data mining/Bayesian Network/Hybrid
